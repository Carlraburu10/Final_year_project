The increasing threat of credit card fraud has necessitated innovative solutions to safeguard financial transactions.
This dissertation introduces a proactive system designed to preemptively detect and prevent fraudulent activities before 
they are approved. Unlike conventional methods that classify transactions post-facto, this system leverages the power of supervised Machine Learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Light GBM, and Random Forest, to analyze transactional
patterns and swiftly identify potential fraud. By scrutinizing a range of transactional features, these algorithms 
offer real-time evaluation, enabling immediate alerts to be sent to legitimate cardholders when suspicious activities 
are detected.# Final_year_project
